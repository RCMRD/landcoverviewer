CREST Flood Simulator Documentation
=======================

Welcome to CREST Flood Simulator Documentation.

The CREST stream flow viewer and flood simulator has the capability to generate a flood map from gauged values for basins that do not have CREST and from CREST outputs. 

First Steps
===========

The following sections give an overview of CREST Flood Simulator from different perspectives, they are targeted at a non-technical audience and the quick installation guide at people who just want to get it installed and will come back later to the complete documentation.


How To Use The Documentation
============================

The documentation is geared toward three distinct types of users:

 #. **Users**: Are people who log into the CREST Flood Simulator online application and use its functionality. 
 #. **Administrators**: Are people who install and deploy CREST Flood Simulator instances in production for their Users. 
 #. **Developers**:  Are people who write code to add functionality, integrate with other systems, fix bugs, and potentially help an Administrator setup a server and deploy a CREST Flood Simulator instance for production. 


The documentation is divided into three sections:

 #. :doc:`Tutorials: <tutorials/index>` Step-by-step instructions in workshop format that help a user to accomplish a set of tasks.
 #. :doc:`Reference: <reference/index>` Architecture, component information, API descriptions etc.
