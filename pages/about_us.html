  The derived land-cover maps are based on a classification of satellite and ancillary data, which can include agricultural census, land-use surveys, and forest maps, and are used to guide and verify the classification of satellite imagery into land-cover maps. RCMRD has verified the land-use/land-cover maps through ground verification campaigns in each country, with the ministries of forest and/or environment as appropriate. Baseline data are provided in the form of Landsat satellite imagery and land-cover maps for 1990 (Malawi and Rwanda), 2000, and 2010. A joint Technical Advisory Board, with participants from the EPA and SERVIR, continues to guide SERVIR-Eastern and Southern Africa to ensure effective integration of the products from these GHG emissions inventories for participating countries.
